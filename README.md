# Design Patterns in Java

This repository demonstrates various design patterns in Java, organized into three main categories: Creational, Behavioral, and Structural. Each pattern is implemented with example code to illustrate its usage.

## Categories

### 1. Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help manage object creation in a way that is flexible and efficient.

#### Patterns Included:
- **Builder Pattern**: Allows the creation of complex objects step by step. Example: Building a customizable pizza with different toppings.
- **Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Example: Creating different types of emojis.

### 2. Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects. They define how objects interact and distribute responsibility.

#### Patterns Included:
- **Observer Pattern**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified. Example: Notifying plant owners when the condition of a plant changes.
- **State Pattern**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. Example: Changing the mood of a mood ring based on different states.

### 3. Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

#### Patterns Included:
- **Decorator Pattern**: Allows adding new behavior to an object dynamically. Example: Adding milk and sugar to a coffee.
